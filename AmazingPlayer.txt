My strategy for creating the AmazingPlayer is as follows:

    I realized that there were six main functions of the player to refine:
    
    These were:
        
        1) Choosing the card to remove a card from deck if player is the dealer
        2) What card to play if player is leading the trick
        3) What card to play if player is NOT leading the trick
        4) Choosing if to play alone before round if player is dealer
        5) Making decisions during first round of bidding
        6) Making decisions during second round of bidding
        
        
    Algorithms:
    
        1) To discard a card while the dealer, AmazingPlayer follows these 
               steps:
            A) Only considers cards in hand that are NOT trump
            B) Checks hand for 9's, discards it
            C) Checks hand for 10's discards it
            D) Looks through hand for groups of similar suits, if one is on 
                   their own, discard it
            E) Else, discards lowest ranking card in hand
            
        2) The algorithm to play a card while leading the trick is simple, yet
               effective. Follows these steps:
            A) If player has either bower, play it, beginning with left
            B) If player has off suit ace or king, play it, beginning with king
            C) Else, play random card
            
        3) For the algorithm to play a card while NOT leading the trick, I
               mixed the most effective parts of my own strategy with the 
               strategy player's existing strategy. Follows these steps:
            A) If a player has a jack of the leading suit, play it (I believe 
                   this is effective as it balances out the odds of each 
                   teammate using both their best cards at once)
            B) If player is able to follow suit, play the highest ranking card 
                   possible
            C) If player cannot follow suit, if player has trump cards, play 
                   lowest ranking trump card, otherwise play lowest ranking 
                   card possible
            
        4) The algorithm for deciding whether or not to play alone is simple, 
               and relies on playing it safe. Follows these steps:
            A) If player has 4 trump cards, play alone
            B) If player has both bowers and a trump card of rank ace, king, or
                   queen, play alone
            C) Else, do not play alone
            
        5) The algorithm for whether or not to call trump during the first 
               round of bidding is based off a point system. Follow these 
               steps:
            A) For each card in deck, add the following points:
                1) If card is a left or right bower, add three points
                2) If card is a face card of the trump, add two points
                3) If card is a 9 or 10 of trump, add one point
            B) If total points are 6 or more, pick up kitty
            C) Else, pass
            
        6) The algorithm for calling trump during the second round of bidding 
               is also based off a point system. Follow these steps:
            A) For each card in deck, add the following points:
                1) If card is a left or right bower, add three points to 
                       corresponding suit point total
                2) If card is a face card of the trump, add two points to 
                       corresponding suit point total
                3) If card is a 9 or 10 of trump, add one point to 
                       corresponding suit point total
            B) If suit point total is 5 or more, call that suit
            C) Else, pass
            
    
In conclusion, I found that these algorithms were very effective against the 
strategy player team. In total, after playing 2000 rounds, I found that the 
amazing team won 77.1% of all games, winning nearly 4 of every 5 games played.
